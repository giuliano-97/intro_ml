## Introduction to Machine Learning 2020 - Assignments

This repository contains the source code for the 4 mini-projects of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" held in the ETH spring semester 2020 (FS20).

The repository contains 5 folders, one per mini-project - with the first project split in two subproject.
Each folder contains a description of the corresponding task and the solution we (my teammate and I) came up with (in Python). Unfortunately the data we used cannot be shared, but similar datasets can be probably found on Kaggle.
