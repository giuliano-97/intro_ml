## Task 1b

This task was about Lasso and Ridge regression and cross-validation.

Given a set of d+1-dimensional training samples from a CSV file, the code in ```main.py``` computes a set of non-linear responses of the feature vectors and then trains a LASSO regression model using sk-learn. The choice of the regularization coefficient is made through cross-validation.
